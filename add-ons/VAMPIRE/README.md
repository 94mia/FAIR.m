## What is it? 
VAMPIRE stands for Variational Algorithm for Mass-Preserving Image REgistration and is an extension to the FAIR toolbox written in MATLAB (https://de.mathworks.com/). The VAMPIRE model is mass-preserving by design and thus adequate in situations where the overall integral of image intensities needs to be preserved in the registration. For example, VAMPIRE has been used for motion correction in cardiac Positron Emission Tomography (PET).

The approach is described in
